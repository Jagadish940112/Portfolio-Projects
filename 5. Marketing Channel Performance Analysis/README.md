### Tools:

### Columns & Values:
1. customer_id = This column contains the numbers from ***1 to 800***. It represents the ***unique identifiers*** for each customer.

2. channel = This column contains four repeating words: "***email marketing***", "***paid advertising***", "***referral***", and "***social media***". These words represent the different ***marketing channels*** used to acquire customers.

3. cost = This column contains four repeating numbers: ***5.246263271***, ***30.45032721***, ***8.320326732***, and ***9.546325668***. These numbers represent the ***cost*** incurred to acquire customers through each respective marketing channel.

4. conversion_rate = This column contains four repeating numbers: ***0.043822229***, ***0.016341492***, ***0.123144979***, and ***0.167592247***. These numbers represent the ***conversion rates*** achieved for each marketing channel, indicating the proportion of customers who converted into ***revenue-generating customers***.

5. revenue = This column contains numbers ranging from ***500 to 4998***. These numbers represent the ***revenue*** generated by each customer.

* Column 2. channel directly ***affects*** Column 3. cost and Column 4. conversion_rate, meaning
  * IF channel = "***email marketing***", THEN cost = ***5.246263271*** AND conversion_rate = ***0.043822229***.
* Refer the table below for values in channel, cost and conversion_rate columns.
